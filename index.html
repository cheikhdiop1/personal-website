            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My journey in technology began in high school, where I was actively involved in lacrosse, marching band, pit orchestra, and symphonic band. Pursuing a Computer Science major was a natural progression for me, as I've always been passionate about creating and working with computers. My role as the secretary of the software engineering club has allowed me to resources and people to help develop my skills and contribute to the community. Additionally, I have had the privilege of being the lead instructor at iD Tech at Towson University for two consecutive years, where I shared my knowledge and enthusiasm for tech with aspiring young minds.
